# **Student Manager Application**

## _Introduction_
This application is an exercise for the FIS laboratory. You can find the lab assignment on the [lab web page](http://labs.cs.upt.ro/~oose/pmwiki.php/FSE/LAB2019).

The application is meant to help you learn _Git_.

## Issue Tracking
For the purpose of demonstrating a complete Agile Workflow, we created a Jira instance that you can find [here](https://loose.atlassian.net/projects/SM/issues). You will need to use the ID's of the User Stories created there in your commit messages.

## _Happy Coding_
Have a nice time implementing the project!
